# Megathon_Amazon


Amazon strives to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. Most of us
know Amazon as a destination where customers can find, discover and buy
anything that they wish to buy online. Amazon has millions​ ​of​ ​sellers
worldwide and, thus, has a vast catalog of product offerings. At Amazon,
we work backwards from seller needs and innovate on their behalf to make
their selling experience seamless, convenient and profitable.

The participants of Megathon-2017 are given this problem statement of
making selling on Amazon ‘fun’ for sellers. This not only means making the
selling experience more enjoyable but also aiming for high ease of use,
incorporating a social angle to selling, striving for top-notch performance,
incorporating interactive features and, of course, innovating. You can even
aim to gamify the whole seller experience, making it addictive and
rewarding.
